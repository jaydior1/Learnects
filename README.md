Learnects
=========

Just starting to learn Python and would love a place for feedback.

- Adding NHTSA API to play around with and learn. "http://jaydior1.github.io/Learnects/" (First project so il stick to it till I learn).

- Added a "ChangeLog" for all subsequent changes, probably not to many as im just learning but hey its here

NHTSA API
=========

- This is my attempt at learning python and API's at the same time, mind you this is the first "program" ive ever writtin, this is the first time ive used an API(or even heard of them) and this is the first programing language ive learned. So I know theres probably alot wrong or better ways of doing things that mabye people will point out, thats why im here, to learn. :)

- That being said this should be straight forward to using it. load it up like you would any other script. Choose your year, make, and model and viola you get your saftey ratings for that car.(In a pretty crude way if i might add)
